# Epidemic
Epidemic is a practice in domain driven design through cloning of a popular board game. The purpose of cloning an existing
game is to remove the complexity that comes with working with an unknown or complicated domain.
By using a pre-existing game with well defined rules and mechanics we essentially get to work with a perfect product owner
to document and drive the design.

## Exercise Details
The exercise will be broken down into two main categories - domain logic implementation and application implementation.
With good design, the domain logic isn't coupled to presentation and is therefore arbitrary. That means it can be presented
as a web, mobile native, console, or even windowed application. For the purpose of this exercise, a Web Application will
be the presentation.

This repository will be tagged with versions for each step of the process.
